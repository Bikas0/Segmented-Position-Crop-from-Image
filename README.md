# Segmented Image Cropper

This project aims to facilitate the segmentation of images using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and subsequently crop the segmented parts from the original image. Additionally, it provides functionality to sort the segmented images based on the Y1 value obtained from the YOLO model results. <br>
